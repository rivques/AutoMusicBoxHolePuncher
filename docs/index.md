### A Side Quest
In fabricating the rollers for this project, I realized I had a perfect opportunity to [explore arc overhangs](https://rivques.github.io/other-random-projects/fun-with-overhangs/), which are a method of 3D printing over thin air when it would otherwise be impossible. Ultimately we didn't end up using the result of this endeavor because the 3D- printed plastic doesn't grip the paper reliably, but this was a fun tangent to follow.
